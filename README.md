## Documentation

This is the companion repository of the official Volto Hands-on Plone training you can find at [https://training.plone.org/5/voltohandson/](https://training.plone.org/5/voltohandson/).
In this training you'll learn on how to create your own website using Volto.

## Quick Start

First get all the requirements installed on your system.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js LTS (12.x)](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Python 3.7.x / 2.7.x](https://python.org/) or
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) (if using the Plone/Guillotina docker images)

### Create Volto App

Create a new Volto project by using the `create-volto-app` utility.

It will bootstrap a Volto project in a folder of your choice with all the required
boilerplate to start customizing your Volto site.

    $ npm install -g yarn
    $ npm install -g @plone/create-volto-app
    $ create-volto-app myvoltoproject
    $ cd myvoltoproject

Although we install and use `yarn`, the `create-volto-app` tool still needs to be
installed using `npm -g` because `yarn` has a different implementation of
global installs.

### Bootstrap the Plone API backend

We recommend Plone as backend of choice for Volto.

You can bootstrap a ready Docker Plone container with all the dependencies and ready for Volto use:

```shell
$ docker run -it --rm --name=plone -p 8080:8080 -e SITE=Plone -e ADDONS="kitconcept.volto" -e ZCML="kitconcept.volto.cors" plone
```

or as an alternative if you have experience with Plone and you have all the
dependencies installed on your system, you can use the supplied buildout in the
`api` folder by issuing the command:

```shell
$ make build-backend
```

### Start Volto

Once inside your Volto project folder:

```shell
$ yarn start
```
